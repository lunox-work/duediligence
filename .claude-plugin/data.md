- **Sent off the machine:** the spec, the ticket it came from and the code
  being judged go to the model backend the person chooses, on their own
  account: a Claude Code session, the Codex CLI, or the Anthropic API with
  their `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. `confirm --from` reads a GitHub issue, or a Jira
  issue with `JIRA_BASE_URL`, `JIRA_EMAIL` and `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, from the
  person's own GitHub or Jira. The first run installs the test toolchain from
  npm, and from pip for Python; Go and Rust use the toolchains already
  installed. There is no telemetry.
- **Personal data:** a ticket can name people; it is stored with the spec
  under `~/.duediligence/specs/` on the same machine.
- **Retention:** duediligence runs no service. What the model backends keep is
  governed by the person's own agreement with that provider.
